# Winter-Food-and-Beverages

## Introduction
This project focuses on the analysis of consumer preferences across three food categories: Drinks, Snacks, and Soup. Using structured and summarized data, the study examines key indicators such as popularity, calorie contribution, and customer ratings to understand consumption patterns and customer behavior. Microsoft Excel was the tool used in completing this project.

## Data Source

## Data Processing
The data was examined for data quality issues and structural anomalies and subsequently put in a good structure for visualization. These processes included
1.	Modification of data type
2.	Merging of tables
3.	Reordering of columns


## Insights

2.	Herbal Tea also recorded the highest overall customer rating, implying a higher level of customer satisfaction.
3.	Soup has the highest total calories, suggesting that it comparatively less healthy than the other items.
4.	There is no perfect correlation between popularity and ratings, as some items with high rating do not necessarily record the highest popularity scores.
